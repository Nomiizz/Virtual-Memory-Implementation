# Virtual Memory Implementation

OS/161 has a very simple virtual memory system, called dumbvm.  The aim of this project is to replace dumbvm with a new virtual memory system that upgrades its functionality. In particular:

* It should be possible for the pages in processâ€™ address spaces to be placed into any free frame of physical memory. That is, the kernel should no longer require that address space segments be stored contiguously in physical memory.

* When a process terminates, the physical frames that were used to hold its pages should be freed, and should become available for use by other processes.
